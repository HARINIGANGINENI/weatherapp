This app doesnâ€™t make any real API calls; instead, it uses static dummy data to simulate the weather API response. A mock function with a delay mimics an asynchronous fetch to keep the app logic realistic. This approach simplifies development by avoiding dependencies on external APIs or API keys, while keeping the code structure ready for easy future integration with real APIs.
